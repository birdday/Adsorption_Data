Github repository of adsorptions data generated in RASPA for a variety of MOFs/Compositions/Presures.

BreathGases_in_Air:
	Majority Gas Species = Nitrogen + Oxygen
	Trace Gas Species = Acetone, Ammonia, Argon, Carbon Dioxide, Hydrogen

CO2_in_Air:
	N2 = 40-100% (1%)
	O2 = 0-30% (1%)
	CO2 = 0-30% (1%)

SIBO_Dataset1:

SIBO_Dataset2:
	Simulation data for determining linear adsorption coefficients for trace gases with carbon dioxide treated as a majority gas species.
	-----
	Majority Gas Species = Nitrogen + Oxygen (4:1 ratio) + Carbon Dioxide (1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%)
	Trace Gas Species = Acetone, Ammonia, Argon, Hydrogen, Hydrogen Disulfide, Methane
